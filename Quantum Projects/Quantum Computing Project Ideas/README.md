# Quantum Computing Project Ideas

## Hello ðŸ‘‹ And Welcome To The Quantum Computing Project Ideas Section.

This section of the repository holds some of the project ideas one could start implementing as they progress in learning Quantum Computing.

The section has following project ideas in the form of Notebooks that one can view and then start building:

1. Communication Via Superdense Coding
